# siwe-rails

This repository contains examples of adding Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) to
Rails applications.

## `custom-controller`

This example uses a custom session controller.

More information can be found at the [project's README](./custom-controller/README.md).

## (WIP) `devise-omniauth`

This example uses [devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) and adds SIWE
as an [omniauth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) extension.

More information can be found at the [project's README](./devise-omniauth/README.md).
