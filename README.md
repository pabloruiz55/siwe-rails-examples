# siwe-rails

This repository contains examples of adding Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) to
Rails applications.

## `custom-controller`

This example uses a custom session controller.

More information can be found at the [project's README](./custom-controller/README.md).

## `omniauth`

This example uses [OmniAuth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) and adds SIWE
as a provider.

More information can be found at the [project's README](./omniauth/README.md).

## `rails-engine`

This example uses the rails gem [siwe_rails](https://github.com/spruceid/siwe_rails),
which adds some endpoints that can be used to integrate SIWE into your application.

More information can be found at the [project's README](./rails-engine/README.md).
